AI Usage Declaration--

I used AI tools as a learning resource to better understand code structures, best practices, and implementation approaches. Every line of code has been reviewed, customized, and implemented by me to ensure it truly represents my vision and skills. The design, personal content, and overall direction remain authentically mine.
